SplayTree
splay: makes chosen node the root of the tree
insertion: works just like in BST, in the end splays inserted element
deletion: finds element to be deleted, splays it(it becomes the root), splits its subtrees, finds max in left subtree, it becomes root
joins tress
height: exactly like in BST
